## capstone project for Machine Learning Fundamentals Codecademy course

In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we've never had before about how different people experience romance.


In this capstone, I have analyzed some data from OKCupid, an app that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users.


The dataset provided has the following columns of multiple-choice data:

- body_type
- diet
- drinks
- drugs
- education
- ethnicity
- height
- income
- job
- offspring
- orientation
- pets
- religion
- sex
- sign
- smokes
- speaks
- status

And a set of open short-answer responses to :

- essay0 - My self summary
- essay1 - What I’m doing with my life
- essay2 - I’m really good at
- essay3 - The first thing people usually notice about me
- essay4 - Favorite books, movies, show, music, and food
- essay5 - The six things I could never do without
- essay6 - I spend a lot of time thinking about
- essay7 - On a typical Friday night I am
- essay8 - The most private thing I am willing to admit
- essay9 - You should message me if…



The purpose of this capstone is to practice formulating questions and implementing Machine Learning techniques to answer those questions.
